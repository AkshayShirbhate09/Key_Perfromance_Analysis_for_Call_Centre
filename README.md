# Key_Perfromance_Analysis_for_Call_Centre

üåü **Introduction:**

Welcome to the Key Performance Analysis for Call Centers project developed as part of the Virtual Internship Program Challenge for PwC's Forage Program. In this project, we analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of call center operations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üéØ **Project Objective:**

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of call centers by analyzing various KPIs. By examining these metrics, we aim to identify areas of improvement and enhance overall operational efficiency.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üîç **Problem Statement:**

Call centers play a crucial role in customer service and support for organizations. However, measuring their performance can be challenging due to the complexity of operations and the multitude of factors involved. This project aims to address this challenge by analyzing KPIs to gain insights into call center performance and identify opportunities for optimization.

üöÄ **Approach for Designing Report:**

1. **Data Collection:** Gathered sample data from call center operations, including metrics such as call volume, wait times, resolution rates, and customer satisfaction scores.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and standardized the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Utilized tools like Power Query Editor to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format data appropriately.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted exploratory analysis to understand the distribution and patterns of KPIs. Utilized visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to identify trends and outliers.

4. **KPI Analysis:** Analyzed various KPIs including average handle time (AHT), first call resolution (FCR) rate, service level agreement (SLA) compliance, and customer satisfaction scores. Evaluated these metrics to assess call center performance and effectiveness.

5. **Visualizations:** Created visually appealing charts and graphs using emojis for added context. Utilized visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to present findings in an easy-to-understand format.

6. **Findings and Recommendations:** Summarized key findings and insights derived from the analysis. Provided actionable recommendations for improving call center performance based on the identified areas of improvement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üîç **Findings:**

- Average handle time (AHT) is within acceptable limits, indicating efficient call handling processes.
- First call resolution (FCR) rate is below the desired target, suggesting a need for improved resolution strategies.
- Service level agreement (SLA) compliance is inconsistent across different time periods, indicating potential resource allocation issues.
- Customer satisfaction scores vary widely, highlighting areas where customer experience can be enhanced.
