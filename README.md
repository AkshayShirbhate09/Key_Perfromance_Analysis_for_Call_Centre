# Key_Perfromance_Analysis_for_Call_Centre

🌟 **Introduction:**

Welcome to the Key Performance Analysis for Call Centers project developed as part of the Virtual Internship Program Challenge for PwC's Forage Program. In this project, we analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of call center operations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 **Project Objective:**

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of call centers by analyzing various KPIs. By examining these metrics, we aim to identify areas of improvement and enhance overall operational efficiency.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔍 **Problem Statement:**

Call centers play a crucial role in customer service and support for organizations. However, measuring their performance can be challenging due to the complexity of operations and the multitude of factors involved. This project aims to address this challenge by analyzing KPIs to gain insights into call center performance and identify opportunities for optimization.

🚀 **Approach for Designing Report:**

1. **Data Collection:** Gathered sample data from call center operations, including metrics such as call volume, wait times, resolution rates, and customer satisfaction scores.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and standardized the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Utilized tools like Power Query Editor to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format data appropriately.

3. **Visualizations:** Created visually appealing charts and graphs using emojis for added context. Utilized visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to present findings in an easy-to-understand format.

4. **Findings and Recommendations:** Summarized key findings and insights derived from the analysis. Provided actionable recommendations for improving call center performance based on the identified areas of improvement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔍 **Findings:**

  1. What is the total number of calls received by the call center?
  2. How does the total number of calls vary over different time periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)?
  3. What percentage of calls were answered by agents?
  4. Is there a trend in the percentage of answered calls over time?
  5. How many calls were abandoned by customers before reaching an agent?
  6. Is there a correlation between wait times and abandoned calls?
  7. What is the average speed at which calls are answered by agents?
  8. Are there any agents who consistently answer calls faster or slower than the average?
  9. What is the average customer satisfaction rating based on resolved queries?
  10. How does the customer satisfaction rating vary across different agents or topics?
  11. How does the performance of each agent compare in terms of metrics like call resolution rate and average talk duration?
  12. Are there any agents who consistently outperform or underperform their peers?
  13. How does the speed of answer vary between different agents or teams?
  14. Is there a correlation between the speed of answer and customer satisfaction rating?
  15. Which topics have the highest count of resolved queries?
  16. Are there any trends or patterns in the distribution of resolved queries across topics?
  17. What is the average talk duration for each agent?
  18. Are there any agents with significantly longer or shorter talk durations compared to their peers?
  19. How many calls were answered and unanswered by each agent?
  20. Is there a correlation between the number of unanswered calls and other performance metrics?
